                    <b>
    My journey into the world of coding began in November 2023 when a challenge in fixing a video game error sparked my interest in programming. Since then, I have completed an intensive coding bootcamp and continuously hone my skills on Codewars.
    
    
    I am driven by a commitment to personal growth and excellence. This mindset fuels my approach to tackling challenges, paying meticulous attention to detail, and maintaining effective communication within diverse teams. My ambition is to launch a successful career in the tech industry, continually expanding my knowledge and contributing to innovative projects.
    
    Outside of coding, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, and watching movies. These hobbies not only provide inspiration but also keep me energized and motivated in my professional endeavors.
    
    I invite you to explore my portfolio to see examples of my work. If you’re interested in collaborating or learning more about my projects, please feel free to reach out. Let’s create something extraordinary together!
    
    Thank you for visiting
